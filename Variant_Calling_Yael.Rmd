# **Day 1:** The problem

Wild-type laboratory strains of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, like the
reference strain S288C or the widely used strain CEN.PK113-7D can grow
on a variety of carbon sources including lactate.

In a publication from a few years ago^1^, a knock-out mutant strain
based on CEN.PK113-7D was generated, in which the gene for the only
known lactate transporter in yeast, *jen1*, is disrupted by an inserted
reporter cassete. As expected, this strain cannot use lactate as a
carbon source. Laboratory evolution was used then on this strain to
obtain two substrains that had regained the ability to grow on lactate.
Both substrains, IMW004 and IMW005, were subjected to WGS to gain
insight into the genomic changes that these strains had undergone
compared to CEN.PK113-7D over \~100 generations of laboratory evolution
and that might explain their ability to grow on lactate despite the
disruption of the *jen1* gene.

Strikingly, the substrains harbored independent point mutations in the
acetate transporter gene *ADY2* and subsequent experiments showed that
these mutations are likely to cause changes in the substrate specificity
of this transporter.

Go to `/mnt/atgc-d2/bioinfoII/drobles/variant_calling/data/`. There, you
will find:

-   The S288C reference sequence in FASTA format (S288C_ref.fa) and its
    index (S288C_ref.fa.fai)

-   a BAM file of NGS reads from the CEN.PK113-7D parent strain (reads
    are a random subset of those available through the NCBI SRA under
    accession number SRX129922) (SRR445715.aligned.sorted.bam) and its
    index (SRR445715.aligned.sorted.bam.bai)

-   a BAM file of NGS reads from the lab-evolved substrain IMW004 (same
    reads as available under the NCBI SRA accession number SRX129995),
    (SRR445716.aligned.sorted.bam) and its index
    (SRR445716.aligned.sorted.bam.bai)

-   a BAM file of NGS reads from the lab-evolved substrain IMW005 (same
    reads as available under the NCBI accession number SRX129996)
    (SRR445717.aligned.sorted.bam) and its index
    (SRR445717.aligned.sorted.bam.bai)

-   Other files related to the work in this module (you can check the
    readme inside this directory if you're curious)

During this week, we will replicate the findings of the original paper
by performing variant calling and quality filtering, and using Ensembl
VEP to predict variant consequences.

```

[**What is the percentage of mapped reads in all three files? Check the
insert size, GC content, per-base sequence content and quality per cycle
graphs. Do they all look reasonable?**]{.underline}

All three datasets have **high mapping percentages (\~96--97%)**,
indicating good alignment quality.

| File      | Total Reads | Mapped Reads | Mapped % |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| SRR445715 | 17,964,244  | 17,503,811   | 97.4%    |
| SRR445716 | 12,870,162  | 12,428,002   | 96.6%    |
| SRR445717 | 13,730,526  | 13,230,229   | 96.4%    |

Insert size:

-   The insert size distribution appears **reasonable**, centered as
    expected for typical paired-end libraries.

-   There is no evidence of major contamination or fragmentation
    anomalies.

GC Content:

-   GC content is within a **normal distribution range** (bell-shaped
    curve).

-   No major GC bias is apparent.

Per-base Sequence Content:

-   Slight **imbalance at the beginning of reads** is visible (common in
    many libraries due to random priming or adapter trimming).

-   Otherwise, base composition stabilizes along the length, suggesting
    acceptable quality.

Quality per cycle:

-   Quality scores are **high throughout** the read cycles in all three
    files.

-   Minimal degradation over cycles; no severe drops at ends.

All quality metrics---**mapped reads, insert size, GC content, per-base
content, and quality per cycle**---are **within expected and acceptable
ranges**. The datasets are of **good quality** and suitable for
downstream analysis.

## 2. Generating a pileup

```         
samtools mpileup  -f /mnt/atgc-d1/bioinfoII/drobles/variant_calling/data/S288C_ref.fa /mnt/atgc-d1/bioinfoII/drobles/variant_calling/data/SRR445715.aligned.sorted.bam | less -S
```

[**What is the read depth at position chrI:29519? What is the reference
base? Are there any non-reference bases?**]{.underline}

```         
chrI    29519   A       56      ,$,,.,.,..,,,,..,..,……….,.,,.,,……..,……….,       BCB=A4BB9>BB@?A>B>B?BBBA@A?CB7?C8AB=@BBBCB=B@@@BBCAC?B00
```

Read depth: 56

Reference base: A

Non-reference bases: None detected (all reads appear to match the
reference)

[**What about at position chrI:29522? What is the reference base? Are
there any non-reference bases?**]{.underline}

```         
chrI    29522   T       46      aaaaAaAAaAAAAAAAAAAaAaaAaaAAAAAAAAaAAAAAAAAAAa  8;??>:4BB@BABB;A=BABBCBBB?ABA=CABBBAAABC5CAB00
```

Read depth: 46

Reference base: T

Non-reference bases: A (possible T -\> A substitution)

## 3. Generating genotype likelihoods and variant calling

```         
module load bcftools/1.10.2

bcftools mpileup -f /mnt/atgc-d1/bioinfoII/drobles/variant_calling/data/S288C_ref.fa /mnt/atgc-d1/bioinfoII/drobles/variant_calling/data/SRR445715.aligned.sorted.bam | bcftools call -m --ploidy 1  | less -S
```

[**Study the command. Why did we use these settings? If you were
performing variant calling in human data, what settings would you
use?**]{.underline}

Is used for variant calling in a haploid organism.

Where:

-   bcftools mpileup: Generates genotype likehoods and raw information
    about sequencing reads aligned to the reference genome

-   -f S288C_ref.fa : Specifies the reference genome.

-   -m : Calls variants using the multiallelic model

-   --ploidy 1: Specifies haploid ploidy because yeast

-   If performing variant calling on human data, the settings would
    change

-   Human are diploid, so we would replace --ploidy 1 with --ploidy 2.

[**What option should we add to only print variant sites?**]{.underline}

To output only variant sites (excluding positions) where no variants are
detected), we need to add the -v flag in bcftools call

```         
bcftools mpileup -a AD -f /mnt/atgc-d1/bioinfoII/drobles/variant_calling/data/S288C_ref.fa /mnt/atgc-d1/bioinfoII/drobles/variant_calling/data/SRR445715.aligned.sorted.bam -Ou | bcftools call -mv --ploidy 1 -o SRR445715.vcf

bcftools mpileup -a AD -f /mnt/atgc-d1/bioinfoII/drobles/variant_calling/data/S288C_ref.fa /mnt/atgc-d1/bioinfoII/drobles/variant_calling/data/SRR445716.aligned.sorted.bam -Ou | bcftools call -mv --ploidy 1 -o SRR445716.vcf

bcftools mpileup -a AD -f /mnt/atgc-d1/bioinfoII/drobles/variant_calling/data/S288C_ref.fa /mnt/atgc-d1/bioinfoII/drobles/variant_calling/data/SRR445717.aligned.sorted.bam -Ou | bcftools call -mv --ploidy 1 -o SRR445716.vcf

less -S SRR445717.vcf
```

[**What is the reference and variant base at position
chrIV:122724?**]{.underline}

```         
chrIV   122724  .   G   A   225 .   DP=58;VDB=0.0205157;SGB=-0.693147;MQSB=1;MQ0F=0;AC=1;AN=1;DP4=0,0,27,26;MQ=60   GT:PL:AD    1:255,0:0,53
```

The reference base is G

The variant (alternative) base is A

[**What is the total read depth at position chrIV:122724?**]{.underline}

The total read depth at position is 58

What is the number of high-quality forward reads supporting the variant
call at position chrIV:122724? How many reads support the reference
allele?

The high-quality forward read supporting the variant (A) is 27

And the total reads supporting the reference (G) is 0 (none detected)

[**What sort of event is happening at position
chrI:29007?**]{.underline}

```         
chrI 29007 . T TG 122 . INDEL;IDV=23;IMF=0.958333;DP=24;VDB=0.0158681;SGB=-0.636426;MQSB=0.882497;MQ0F=0;AC=1;AN=1;DP4=4,13,2,5;MQ=35 GT:PL:AD 1:149,0:17,7
```

The reference allele is T, and variant allele is TG. Indicates that is a
variant base. Is an insertion event (indel)

## 4. Variant filtering

In the series of commands we will learn how to filter and extract
information from VCFs. Most of the `bcftools` commands accept the `-i`,
`--include` and `-e`, `--exclude` options which will come handy when
filtering using fixed thresholds (you can look at the `bcftools`
documentation here: <http://www.htslib.org/doc/bcftools.html>). We will
estimate the quality of the callset by calculating the
transition/transversion ratio

In order to verify that the filtering expression has the desired effect,
it is useful to first run a few small tests. Let's start with printing a
simple list of positions from the VCF using the bcftools query command
(manual) and pipe through the head command to trim the output after a
few lines:

```         
bcftools query -f'POS = %POS\n' SRR445715.vcf | head
```

```         
POS = 83
POS = 136
POS = 262
POS = 286
POS = 305
POS = 476
POS = 485
POS = 610
POS = 633
POS = 654
```

The formatting expression "`POS = %POS\n`" was expanded for each line in
the VCF and consisted of the string "`POS =`", which was printed on the
output unchanged, the string with a special meaning "`%POS`", which was
replaced by the `POS` column for each line, and the new line character
"", which put the new line character after each VCF record. (If it were
not present, the positions from the entire VCF would be printed on a
single line.)

Now add REF and ALT allele to the output, separated by a comma

```         
bcftools query -f'%POS %REF,%ALT\n' SRR445715.vcf | head
```

```         
83 AG,A
136 G,A
262 A,G
286 A,T
305 C,G
476 G,T
485 T,C
610 G,A
633 T,C
654 C,T
```

In the next step add also the quality, genotype and sequencing depth to
the output. For the depth, check the `AD` annotation, which gives the
number of reads observed for each reference and alternate alleles. For
example, if there were 3 reads with the reference allele and 5 reads
with the alternate allele, the `AD` field would be `AD=3,5`. Note that
the FORMAT fields must be enclosed within square brackets "[]" to
iterate over all samples in the VCF.

To illustrate this, first let's make a combined VCF:

```         
module load htslib/1.9
bgzip SRR445715.vcf
bgzip SRR445716.vcf
bgzip SRR445717.vcf
bcftools index SRR445715.vcf.gz
bcftools index SRR445716.vcf.gz
bcftools index SRR445717.vcf.gz
bcftools merge -0 -o combined.vcf SRR445715.vcf.gz SRR445716.vcf.gz SRR445717.vcf.gz
```

```         
bcftools query -f'%POS %QUAL [%GT %AD  ] %REF %ALT\n' combined.vcf | head
```

```         
83 154 1 0,11  1 2,21  1 1,12   AG A
136 149 1 0,27  1 0,68  1 0,33   G A
244 20.8314 0 .  0 .  1 7,15   C CT
262 5.13241 1 11,12  0 .  0 .   A G
286 223 1 0,43  1 0,83  1 0,40   A T
305 203 1 0,48  1 0,67  1 0,36   C G
476 166 1 0,31  1 0,44  1 0,23   G T
485 66 1 0,11  0 .  0 .   T C
509 23.5345 0 .  0 .  1 9,20   G A
546 15.6659 0 .  0 .  1 37,41   C T
```

[**Can you print rows with `QUAL` bigger than 30 and with at least 50
alternate reads?**]{.underline}

For this we will need to query the second value of the `AD` field. Note
that the indexes are zero-based; the first `AD` value is represented as
"`AD[0]`", therefore the second value must be queried as "`AD[1]>=50`".
However, you will also need to indicate which sample to look at, to look
at any sample you can use the asterisk (e.g. the instruction would look
like "`AD[*:1]>=50`") **Hint**: If you get stuck, look at the examples
that Petr Danecek (pd3) explained here:
<https://github.com/samtools/bcftools/issues/757>

Yes, with this command

```         
bcftools query -f'%POS %QUAL [%GT %AD  ] %REF %ALT\n' -i'QUAL>=30 && AD[*:1]>=50' combined.vcf | head
```

```         
136 149 1 0,68   G A
286 223 1 0,83   A T
305 203 1 0,67   C G
610 225 1 0,58  1 0,106  1 0,76   G A
633 227 1 27,99  1 18,67   T C
681 225 1 0,57   G A
686 161 1 21,64   A G
778 228 1 0,63  1 12,57   A G
1008 225 1 0,81  1 0,60   A G
1013 225 1 0,79  1 0,68   T C
```

Finally, use the following command to obtain the ts/tv of an unfiltered
callset.

```         
bcftools stats SRR445715.vcf.gz | grep TSTV | cut -f5
```

```         
# TSTV, transitions/transversions:
[5]ts/tv
2.94
```

[**How does the ts/tv change if you apply the filters
above?**]{.underline} Use the `bcftools stats` command with the `-i`
option to include calls with `QUAL` at least 30 and the number of
alternate reads at least 50.

The command that I used for apply the filters is:

```         
bcftools stats -i'QUAL>=30 && AD[*:1]>=50' SRR445715.vcf.gz | grep TSTV | cut -f5
```

```         
# TSTV, transitions/transversions:
[5]ts/tv
3.31
```

The original ratio without the filters is 2.94 and this change to 3.31
when apply the filters above.

[**What is the ts/tv of removed sites?**]{.underline}

```         
bcftools stats -e'QUAL>=30 && AD[*:1]>=50' SRR445715.vcf.gz | grep TSTV | cut -f5
```

```         
# TSTV, transitions/transversions:
[5]ts/tv
2.46
```

The ts/tv of **removed sites** is 2.46.

Another useful command is `filter` which allows you to annotate the VCF
file with soft filters based on the given expression, rather than
removing the sites completely. Can you apply the above filters to
produce a final callset and apply the -g and -G options to soft filter
variants around indels?

```         
bcftools filter -sLowQual -m+ -i'QUAL>=30 && AD[*:1]>=50' -g8 -G10 combined.vcf -o combined.flt.vcf
```

[**Can you see why position chrI:1101 passed these filters? And why did
position chrI:1107 fail the filtering step?**]{.underline}

ChrI:1101

```         
chrI    1101    .   G   A   152 PASS    VDB=0.254259;SGB=-0.693139;MQSB=0;MQ0F=0.0263158;MQ=27;DP=132;DP4=0,0,4,121;AN=3;AC=3   GT:PL:AD    1:182,0:0,36    1:172,0:0,58    1:104,0:0,31
```

ChrI:1107

```         
chrI    1107    .   T   C   84  LowQual VDB=0.00141136;SGB=-0.690438;RPB=0.0691938;MQB=0.0756927;MQSB=0.0144103;BQB=0.242036;MQ0F=0.0416667;MQ=24;DP=79;DP4=5,0,1,70;AN=3;AC=3  GT:PL:AD    1:116,5:5,17    1:114,0:0,32    1:84,0:0,22
```

The chrI:1101 position passed the filters because it meets the quality
criteria (QUAL \>= 30) and has at least one sample with sufficient
alternative readings (AD[\*:1] \>= 50). There is no indication that it
is near an indel (it was not affected by -g8 or -G10).

On the other hand, position 1107 did not pass filters because no sample
has at least 50 alternative readings (AD[\*:1] \>= 50). Even if it has
good quality greater than 30.

## 5. Multi-sample variant calling

Many experiments involve sequencing multiple samples to compare the
genetic variation between the samples. Therefore, we need to have a
genotype for each sample at all variant sites. Typically this is
achieved by carrying out multi-sample variant calling where all of the
sequencing data is given to the variant caller simultaneously.

There are three BAM files in the original directory
`/mnt/atgc-d2/bioinfoII/drobles/variant_calling/data/`.

[**Can you modify the command from section 3 to use all three BAM files
and only write out variant sites in *chromosome I*?**]{.underline} Write
the output to a compressed BCF file called multi.bcf and index the file
afterwards.

The command that realize this is:

```         
bcftools mpileup -Ou -f /mnt/atgc-d1/bioinfoII/drobles/variant_calling/data/S288C_ref.fa -r chrI  -a AD /mnt/atgc-d1/bioinfoII/drobles/variant_calling/data/SRR445715.aligned.sorted.bam /mnt/atgc-d1/bioinfoII/drobles/variant_calling/data/SRR445716.aligned.sorted.bam /mnt/atgc-d1/bioinfoII/drobles/variant_calling/data/SRR445717.aligned.sorted.bam | bcftools call -mv -Ob -o multi.bcf
```

Now we index the multi.vcf

```         
bcftools index multi.bcf
```

[**Can you apply the same filters as before? How many sites pass the
filters? Write the output to a BCF file called multi.filt.bcf and index
the file.**]{.underline}

The command that we use to filtering is:

```         
bcftools filter -sLowQual -m+ -i'QUAL>=30 && AD[*:1]>=50' -g8 -G10 multi.bcf -o multi.filt.bcf
```

Then we index the filtered BCF file and count the variants that passing
sites with:

```         
bcftools index multi.filt.bcf
bcftools view -f PASS multi.filt.bcf | grep -vc "^#"
```

477 variants passed the filters

[**What is the ts/tv of the raw calls and of the filtered
set?**]{.underline}

For unfiltered calls we use the command to obtain the ratio ts/tv

```         
bcftools stats multi.bcf | grep TSTV | cut -f5
```

```         
# TSTV, transitions/transversions:
[5]ts/tv
2.51
```

And we have a 2.51 ratio ts/tv. Then we use the next command for
filtered set of variants.

We create a new file whit only the variants passed the filtering

```         
bcftools view -f PASS multi.filt.bcf -Ob -o multi.filt.PASS.bcf
bcftools stats multi.filt.PASS.bcf | grep TSTV | cut -f5
```

```         
# TSTV, transitions/transversions:
[5]ts/tv
3.14
```

This gives us a ratio for the variants that passed the filter of 3.14

# **Day 2 :** VEP and more `bcftools` analyses

## 1. Thinking about our experiment

First, what are the differences between the parent strain of the study
(CEN.PK113-7D) and the reference strain S288C? The (unfiltered)
differences of course are the variant calls present in
`SRR445715.vcf.gz`, as we used the S288C genome as a reference. But, how
do we find the differences between the evolved strain IMW004 and its
parent CEN.PK113-7D? For this, we can also use bcftools:

```         
bcftools isec -C SRR445716.vcf.gz SRR445715.vcf.gz > present_in_IMW004_absent_in_CEN.PK113-7D.txt
```

From this analysis, we can see there are a number of variants present in
IMW004 that were not present in its parent strain.

Okay, so now the real question. What are the variants, and the gene,
underlying the newly acquired ability of IMW004 and IMW005 to grow on
lactate? Since these two strains have evolved completely separately, the
chance of them sharing an exactly identical variant that is not present
in their parent strain is extremely low. However, it is certainly
possible that different variants in the two strains will affect the same
genomic feature (*e.g.*, the same gene), which could then be taken as
evidence that this gene may be of importance for the observed biological
effect (growth on lactate in this case). **Hint 2:** Study the
`bcftools isec` and `bcftools merge` commands.

[**Can you think of a way to obtain a list of candidates that may
underlie the ability of these strains to grow on lactate?**]{.underline}
Hint: You can assume that variants shared by both IMW004 and IMW005 are
likely to have arisen before the start of the experiment (*i.e.*, from
the unsequenced initial *jen1* delta strain), and therefore are not
biologically interesting. [**How many variants (unfiltered) are in
IMW004 that are not shared by any other strain?**]{.underline}

To identify candidates underlying lactate growth, we focused on variants
that are:

-   Present in either IMW004 or IMW005

-   Absent from their parental strain (CEN.PK113-7D)

-   Not shared between IMW004 and IMW005 (to exclude background
    mutations from the jen1Δ ancestor)

Such unique variants are more likely to have arisen independently during
adaptation and may affect the same gene via different mutations.

Next, to focus on **unique variants**, we removed those shared with
IMW005 (SRR445717.vcf.gz). To do this properly, we will convert the file
into a valid VCF (with headers) using `bcftools isec -w1 -O v`, and then
apply:

```         
bcftools isec -w1 -O v -p isec_IMW004 SRR445716.vcf.gz SRR445715.vcf.gz

module load htslib/1.9

bgzip isec_IMW004/0000.vcf
bcftools index isec_IMW004/0000.vcf.gz

bcftools isec -C isec_IMW004/0000.vcf.gz SRR445717.vcf.gz -w1 > IMW004_only.vcf
```

This final file contains variants **present only in IMW004**, and **not
in the parent nor in IMW005**.

```         
grep -v "^#" IMW004_only.vcf | wc -l
```

We found **209 unique unfiltered variants** in IMW004 that are not
shared with CEN.PK113-7D or IMW005.

Now, can you apply filters to remove those sites that are not
well-covered? let's set it at DP\>30 and QUAL\>50.

[**How many variants remain in IMW004 after filtering?**]{.underline}

We applied filters to retain only high-confidence variants in IMW004,
using the expression `DP > 30 && QUAL > 50`. This removed poorly
supported sites from the set of private variants.

Using the following command:

```         
bcftools view -i'DP>30 && QUAL>50' IMW004_only.vcf -Ov -o IMW004_only.filtered.vcf

grep -v "^#" IMW004_only.filtered.vcf | wc -l
```

We found **20 variants** that remain after filtering.

Now, do the same you did for IMW004 but now for IMW005.

[**How many variants remain in IMW005 after filtering?**]{.underline}

```         
bcftools isec -w1 -O v -p isec_IMW005 SRR445717.vcf.gz SRR445715.vcf.gz

bgzip isec_IMW005/0000.vcf
bcftools index isec_IMW005/0000.vcf.gz

bcftools isec -C isec_IMW005/0000.vcf.gz SRR445716.vcf.gz -w1 > IMW005_only.vcf

bcftools view -i'DP>30 && QUAL>50' IMW005_only.vcf -Ov -o IMW005_only.filtered.vcf

grep -v "^#" IMW005_only.filtered.vcf | wc -l
```

We identified variants exclusive to IMW005 by comparing it against the
parent strain (CEN.PK113-7D) and removing any variants also found in
IMW004.

This yielded **15 variants** after filtering.

## 2. Running Ensembl VEP and obtaining the information about biological consequences

Now we will run Ensembl VEP on our files and see what gene consequences
our mutations have. Previous to this, I installed the yeast cache (a
local database so we don't have to connect to the database in the UK) in
my home directory, so we can use these. To run VEP:

```         
module load vep/r99.2
vep --cache --dir_cache /home/drobles/.vep/ \
    -i IMW004_only.filtered.vcf \
    -o IMW004_only.filtered.vep.vcf \
    --vcf --species "saccharomyces_cerevisiae"
    
vep --cache --dir_cache /home/drobles/.vep/ \
    -i IMW005_only.filtered.vcf \
    -o IMW005_only.filtered.vep.vcf \
    --vcf --species "saccharomyces_cerevisiae"
```

[**What do all the options that we added to the command
mean?**]{.underline} **Hint:** Look at the full options in
<http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/script/vep_options.html>.

-   `--cache`: use local annotation files (faster and doesn't require
    internet).

-   `--dir_cache /home/drobles/.vep/`: points to the yeast cache
    previously downloaded.

-   `-i`: input file with variants (`IMW004_only.filtered.vcf` or
    `IMW005_only.filtered.vcf`)

-   `-o`: output file with annotation.

-   `--vcf`: tells VEP to produce a VCF output format

-   `--species`: selects the right genome/annotation (Saccharomyces
    cerevisiae).

[**Look at the output VCF. What happened to the original VCF? Did VEP
add an annotation? Which one?**]{.underline}

VEP added annotations under the `INFO` field of the output VCF
(`.vep.vcf`). The main field added is `CSQ`, which gives biological
consequences such as:

-   Type of variant (e.g., missense_variant, synonymous_variant)

-   Impact level (e.g., HIGH, MODERATE)

-   Gene name and transcript ID

## 3. Making sense of our results

Run VEP on both IMW004 and IMW005 filtered VCF files. Study the output
very well. Now create a program in your favourite language that outputs:

-   Genes are mutated in any or both of the files

-   What mutation is present in what strain

Did you find the original mutations found by the authors in the ADY2
gene?

```         
YBR219C YBR219C_mRNA    SRR445716   frameshift_variant, 103-106 HFFF/HFFFX
YBR300C YBR300C_mRNA    SRR445716   frameshift_variant, 120 V/DX
YCR010C (ADY2)  YCR010C_mRNA    SRR445716   missense_variant, 252 A/G
YCR010C (ADY2)  YCR010C_mRNA    SRR445717   missense_variant, 219 L/V
YDR534C (FIT1)  YDR534C_mRNA    SRR445717   missense_variant, 310 E/G
YFL023W (BUD27) YFL023W_mRNA    SRR445717   missense_variant, 493 V/I
YHR213W-B   YHR213W-B_mRNA  SRR445717   missense_variant, 44 T/R
YKL030W YKL030W_mRNA    SRR445716   frameshift_variant, 25 Y/YX
YMR245W YMR245W_mRNA    SRR445716   frameshift_variant, 174-175 NI/NIX
```

Yes, the ADY2 gene is mutated in both strains and the amino acid changes
are different.

[**Filter the consequences to only keep those that are either missense,
stop gained, frameshift, splice acceptor or splice donor. These are
typically the mutations that are predicted to directly affect protein
function. How many genes are mutated with any of these consequences in
both strains?**]{.underline}

Only one gen are mutated in both strains, this gene is ADY2.
